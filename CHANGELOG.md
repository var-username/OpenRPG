# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). However, note that all pre-v0.5.0 releases will have the suffix "-dev"


## [0.5.2]
### Added
- Added a openrpg.json file to our `data/` folder allowing us to better tell when we have found our data folder

### Fixed
- Added more check locations to both `export.js` as well as the `LOCATE_DATA()` function in the Utils module. The lack of these locations was causing OpenRPG to be unable to locate our `data/`

## [0.5.1]
### Added
- After installing you can now run `man openrpg` for Unix style Man Pages thanks to [@var-username](https://github.com/var-username)
- Calling `npm install` on this package will attemmpt to download the prebuild binaries from the matching github release putting it in `dist/` (if `dist/` already exists, it is cleared). `build.js` attempts to determine the correct node or electron version to download, and if one cannot be found we fall back to the core libaries. If `build.js` is still unable to locate the files, or the sha512 checksum fails, nothing is downloaded.

### Changed
- Moved the ASSET_LOC from a preprocessor definition to a Core module function that searches multiple locations until it finds our data directory, throwing an error if no data can be found
- Core now takes advantage of the STL C++17 Filesystem library to locate our data folder using an array of paths
- Updated README.md with NodeJS info and updates to the build scripts, as well as some reorganization of pertinent information.
- Check and specify system architecture in build.bat


## [0.5.0]
There is likely a TON that has changed that is not noted below. This release is a HUGE one, so we likely missed something. If you notice something is missing, please open a PR to fix it (with commit citations please)!

### Added
- We are now on the Arch User Repository and supporting Arch as our first Linux distro, as it is what I ([@incomingstick](http://github.comincomingstick)) use!
    - You can use the PKGBUILD branch of this Repo to build from `makepkg` that way
    - Clone us out of the AUR yourself by running `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/openrpg-git.git && cd openrpg-git && makepkg -si`
    - You can use your favorite AUR helper, such as `yay`
        - Run `$ yay -S openrpg`
- We have improved our CMake logic to include the use of CPack for packaging, for all supported OS's! Check out our [downloads](https://openrpg.io/download/) page for your systems installer!
- Build scripts now include a package target for packaging with CPack
- NodeJS and `npm` integrated into the project workflow. You can now use `npm` and subsequently `cmake-js` to compile an additional `orpgAddon.node` binary that is a compiled Node module. 
    - This NodeJS addon aims to be a complete wrap of the C++ libraries. As such, most functions and classes should operate as you would expect the C++ counterpart.
    - Expose the `VERSION` preprocessor definition via the `ORPG_VERSION()` function
- An ASCII character sheet in `data/` thanks to [@var-username](https://github.com/var-username)
    - data/character_sheets/ascii_char_sheet
    - "data/character_sheets/Blank ASCII Character Sheet.txt"
- Added build info for Windows and improved the Unix documentation
- Added an uninstall target to CMake and Make, allowing for the use of `make uninstall` to... uninstall
    - cmake_uninstall.cmake.in
- build.sh has a ton of new commands, including an uninstall command `$ ./build.sh uninstall`
- This Changelog! You are likely looking at CHANGELOG.md
- The OGL is now in our main LICENSE, in addition to the OSL, to hopefully cover our bases with that stuff... hopefully we don't accidentally use copyright WotC stuff, or anyones stuff for that matter
- We now generate export headers via CMake for the Windows DLLs to ensure proper linking
- Some suggested vim settings, if thats your editor of choice
- TravisCI Windows builds! We are now testing Windows via TravisCI, as well as AppVeyor
- OSC XCode8 tests on TravisCI!
- Lots of namespacing to help prevent name collision when our project is used, the structure is as follows:
    - `ORPG`
    - `ORPG::Core`
    - `ORPG::Utils`
    - `ORPG::Roll`
    - `ORPG::Names`
    - `ORPG::Character`
- `NameGenerator` class now has a constructor that takes a file location as a `std::string`, here are some important notes:
    - By creating this constructor we are allowing an end user to specify the location the namelist we will read from. It is extremely important we explore any possible security implications of this further. I [@incomingstick](http://github.comincomingstick)) do think it could prove a beneficial feature to allow end users to specify namelists.
    - I, [@incomingstick](http://github.comincomingstick), created this function specifically to help the test suite. When testing on a fresh system, we are built before we test, but the release builds defines ASSET_LOC as: "/usr/local/data/openrpg" Because of this, it attempts to check a folder that has not been installed yet, and we need a way to point NameGenerator to our source data folder.
- Character module  now takes full advantage of our Names library to allow for the use of first and last names
- Added the Elf race to the Characters library
    - `class Elf : public Character`
    - `class HighElf : public Elf`
- `CharacterFactory` class has a new constructor that takes a name as a `std::string`
- Character library has a new class, `Skill` that helps represent the 5e Skill in a better way, and makes use of the new `EnumSkill` enum to pair score to human readable tags thanks to [@var-username](https://github.com/var-username)
- `ExpressionParser` now handles the modulo operation!

### Changed
- Building Libraries as Dynamic instead of Static, because why wouldn't a game want Dynamic/Shared libraries!
- Split .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md into two files:
    - .github/FEATURE_REQUEST.md
    - .github/BUG_REPORT.md
- Renamed `int random(...)` to `int randomInt(...)` in the Utils namespace thanks to [@var-username](https://github.com/var-username)
- Fixed some install locations to better form to different platforms
- build.bat now has actual commands such as `> .\build.bat clean`, or `> .\build.bat rebuild` as well as better error reporting
- Make sure we don't accidentally add some packaged/compressed files to the repo, cuz that would be obnoxious
- Lots of "auto-fication" across the project, as well as other C++11 improvements
- Lots of restructuring within the files themeselves to help keep things better organized
- Lots of additional documention comments throughout the project for you other devs out there
- `levels[]` is now an externally definded global variable renamed to `EXP[]` in the `include/character/character.h` header, so you must link to the Character library to use is
- The `Skills` struct is now a class that acts as a wrapper of sorts for the `Skill` class and the `EnumSkill` enum thanks to [@var-username](https://github.com/var-username)
- `Character` class now uses the `Skills` class internally and has a new function to interface with it via `void update_skills()` thanks to [@var-username](https://github.com/var-username)
- Some header guards improved to better show their purpose in the project file system

### Fixed
- Typo in the Warforged namelist that gave "Zealot" a period (was "Zealot.")
- Consistant URL usage for [openrpg.io](https://openrpg.io)
- Better CMake output to help you developers understand whats going where / when.
- When installed on some systems, the creation of a data folder could potentially cause VSCode to fail to open
- Linking issues when running `make check` could cause some tests to fail, on some systems
- Issue when running `make check` on a release build, that caused the tests to be unable to locate the data assets
- A bug that would cause some divide by zero operations, as well as preventing the rolling of a 1 sided die thanks to [@tehguy](https://github.com/tehguy)
- A typo in the roll parser test that was incorrectly validating d6's thanks to [@pashcovich](https://github.com/pashcovich)
- Missing note in Core::print_basic_help() about how to exit OpenRPG.
- Fixed a bug in the ExpressionTree where the `globalReadOffset` was not being reset when a new expression was set
- Fixed a bug when stringing multiple rolls together that would causing the tree to parse an expression such as 2d6+4d8 as (2d6+4)d8
    - Honestly there are a TON of bug fixes with the roll parser now that we are using the Mocha test suite
- Fixed a bug in NameGenerator that wasn't resetting the raceFile when a new race was set
- Fixed version sheild in CHANGELOG.md (it still had the '-dev'affix)

### Removed
- Obliterated the old Name Generator test src/tests/name-generator-test.cpp


## [0.4.4-dev] - 2017-11-05
### Added
- Windows build script: build.bat
- A `help` or `h` command in the orpg console `orpg >`
- A Code of Conduct! See .github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

### Changed
- Put back the Linux Clang 5.0 build that was hidden in the last patch
- TravisCI builds on OSX will do a brew update, as sometimes they were not up to date for the build we were trying to do...

### Removed
- All Unix/POSIX headers to allow for compilation on Windows
- Some redundant headers
- The `get_console_width()` and `get_console_height()` functions
- The TODO's list from the Contributing file, .github/CONTRIBUTING.md


## [0.4.3-dev] - 2017-10-14
### Removed
- TravisCI was failing internally when trying to use Clang 5.0 through the LLVM toolchain on Linux via the truster repository. Specifically it would fail during an apt call, something outside of our control, so we simple will hide this test for now.


## [0.4.2-dev] - 2017-06-02
### Added
- A whole suite of new TravisCI builds for testing GCC, LLVM, and Clang compilers on multiple platforms

### Changed
- The build compiler is set to c++14 and the individual modules have `CXX_STANDARD` set to 11 in CMake


## [0.4.1-dev] - 2017-05-31
### Fixed
- A fatal bug from running `make check` in the Roll Parser test that was calling a function that no longer existed...


## [0.4.0-dev] - 2017-05-31
### Added
- `INCLUDE` rule for our `include/` folder in CMakeLists.txt to install the headers with our library when running `make install`
- `build.sh` support for "darwin" (OSX) and "cygwin" builds
- Install rules for TravisCI in .travis.yml

- The Character library now contains a constant array, `levels[]`, with 20 integers that contain the experince values used when determining if you should level up
- The traditional alignment grid is expressed via the `Alignment` enum in the Character library
- All of the 5e languages are expressed via the `Language` enum in the Character library
- The Charcter library contains a small `enum Gender`

- A function `int gen_stat()` that generates an array of stats > 1 && < 20 in the Character library
- A function `int modifier(...)` that returns an integer representation of the passed ability modifier defined as `(abil - 10) / 2` exactly
    - Note, this is intended to always round down. Data loss is acceptable, as it is a floor function
- A `Character` class that is the general outline for a 5e character sheet, with a few additions that a programmer may find handy
- "Race" classes that are children of the `Character` class that make use of the `Ability` struct to apply racial bonuses:
    - `class Human : public Character {...}`
    - `class Dwarf : public Character {...}`
    - `class HillDwarf : public Dwarf {...}`

    - api/Cargo.toml
    - api/main.rs
    - api/Rocket.toml

- `bool print_file(std::string file)` to the Utils library that prints the text contents of the given file
- `int verbose(string log, int status)` to the Utils library that outputs the log string to `stderr` if `VB_FLAG` is set
- `int parse_input(string in)` to the Utils library that parses text input into the console and determines the appropriate response/action such as calling `roll`, or `generator`, from another process
- `TESTING_FLAG` and `TESTING_ASSET_LOC` preprocessor definitions for help distinguishing when testing
- src/lib/config.h from CMake output of config.h.in saved with source ([@ShinyHobo](https://github.com/ShinyHobo))

### Changed
- Made .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md more concise
- Renamed `src/main.cpp` -> `src/openrpg.cpp`
- Utils `parse(...)` to help the roll module to handle addition and subtraction of all standard D&D dice in additon to D2 and D30 ([@ShinyHobo](https://github.com/ShinyHobo))
- Moved the `assets/` folder into the `src/` folder ([@ShinyHobo](https://github.com/ShinyHobo))
    - assets/banners/welcome_mat1 -> src/assets/banners/welcome_mat1
    - assets/names/dwarf/female -> src/assets/names/dwarf/female
    - assets/names/dwarf/last -> src/assets/names/dwarf/last
    - assets/names/dwarf/male -> src/assets/names/dwarf/male
- Linking to Generator and Roll modules when building openrpg so we don't have to call system commands from ([@ShinyHobo](https://github.com/ShinyHobo))
- Building with C++11 as a standard across the project ([@ShinyHobo](https://github.com/ShinyHobo))

### Fixed
- consistant commenting for file headings
- Typos in CMakeLists.txt
- `make check` can now properly be run prior to `make install`


### Removed
- Git CMake package hook as there is no current need for our software to understand its own git versioning
- Post `openrpg` CMake build target that copied the assets folder after building
